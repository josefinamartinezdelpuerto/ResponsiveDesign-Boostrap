                        and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded

                        Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds

                        dead

                        Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to

                        spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again
                        at a
                        twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its

                    <p class="row mx-0">
                        Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are
                        united
                        by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil.
                        Whether
                        sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest,
                        in a
                        sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in
                        a
                        moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the
                        only
                        witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a
                        source
                        of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed
                        champion.

                    <h3 class="row mx-0 text-danger-emphasis">The Cause of
                        Righteousness</h3>
                    <p class="row mx-0">A paladin swears to uphold justice and
                        righteousness, to stand with the good things of the
                        world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the
                        forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins
                        focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness,
                        but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to
                        do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted
                        to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a
                        commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p>
                    <p class="row mx-0">Paladins train for years to learn the
                        skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and
                        armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to
                        the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and
                        injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to
                        protect the innocent and those who join them in the
                        fight for justice.</p>
                    <h3 class="row mx-0 text-danger-emphasis">Beyond the Mundane
                        Life</h3>
                    <p class="row mx-0">
                        Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an
                        adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him
                        or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin
                        lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against
                        evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the
                        militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people
                        can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do
                        receive the call, these warriors turn from their former
                        occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes
                        their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as
                        leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their
                        loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to
                        crown and country.
                    </p>

                    <p class="row mx-0">
                        Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve
                        into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest
                        driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of
                        treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests,
                        and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the
                        cosmic balance away from oblivion

                        appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that
                        choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of

                        descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or
                        are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on
                        those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of

                        Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while
                        you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the
                        potential within you and decide to train you as a
                        squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of
                        your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you
                        stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave
                        and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of
                        goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your
                        earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your
                        calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world
                        with that purpose stamped on your soul.

                        As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins
                        are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the
                        paths of charity and justice. Consider how your
                        alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and
                        the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and
                        mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or
                        your oath might represent standards of behavior that you
                        have not yet attained.
